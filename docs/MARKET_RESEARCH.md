# Market Research: Election Data Tools for Hudson Valley

## Executive Summary

Brian's Boards operates in a gap between enterprise campaign platforms (VAN, L2, Catalist) designed for statewide/national campaigns with five-figure budgets, and raw data sources (MIT Election Lab, VEST) designed for academic researchers. Neither serves the local operative who needs precinct-level analysis without the overhead.

## Competitive Landscape

### Enterprise Platforms
- **NGP VAN/VoteBuilder** - Democratic campaigns, thousands/month, party-exclusive
- **L2 Political** - Bipartisan, ~$0.25/voter record, voter data focus
- **Catalist** - Progressive orgs, $650/state/cycle minimum
- **TargetSmart** - Large campaigns, enterprise pricing
- **Aristotle** - Both parties, enterprise, since 1983

Gap: These optimize for voter contact. Weak on results analysis.

### Data/Research Sources
- **MIT Election Lab** - Precinct-level returns, requires cleaning
- **VEST** - Academic format, not actionable
- **OpenElections** - Standardized results, incomplete coverage

Gap: Excellent for researchers. Unusable for campaign managers.

## User Segments

1. **Down-Ballot Campaign Managers** - Budget under $50K, need precinct vulnerability scoring, historical trends, rolloff analysis
2. **County Party Committees** - Need cross-race comparison, resource allocation guidance
3. **Political Consultants** - Need automated PDF extraction, client-ready visualizations
4. **Local Journalists** - Need pre-analyzed results, embeddable visualizations
5. **Civic Organizations** - Need public-facing dashboards, educational context

## Our Unique Value

1. **PDF Extraction Infrastructure** - Tedious work competitors won't do for regional market
2. **Local Knowledge** - Understanding Hudson Valley county formats
3. **Vulnerability Scoring** - Precinct-level competitiveness (VAN scores voters, not precincts)
4. **Turnout/Rolloff Integration** - Combination doesn't exist elsewhere

## Key Insight: Rolloff

Sister District research shows rolloff affects Democrats more than Republicans in state legislative races. This is exactly the kind of insight we can surface:
- Which precincts have high rolloff?
- How does rolloff correlate with presidential margin?
- Are rolloff patterns improving or worsening?

## Positioning Options

1. **"VAN for Down-Ballot Results Analysis"** - Results analysis that VAN should have built
2. **"Hudson Valley Election Intelligence"** - Deep local expertise
3. **"Precinct-Level Campaign Analytics"** - MIT quality, campaign manager usability

## Recommendations

### Near-Term
- Talk to 5 Hudson Valley campaign managers about pain points
- Talk to 2-3 county party chairs about resource allocation
- Find one friendly journalist for embedded visualizations

### Medium-Term
- Nail PDF extraction for all Hudson Valley formats
- Build vulnerability dashboard (competitiveness, trend, rolloff)
- Price for accessibility ($50-200/month for campaigns, free tier for journalists)

### Long-Term
- Expand to other NY regions
- Add 10-year historical depth
- Consider white-labeling for county parties
